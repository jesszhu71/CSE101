This is an assignment returns the number of nodes between two string in avl bst.

------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE:
1) Run "make", to get executable "wordrange".
2) Run "./wordrange <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>"

Each line of the input file contains a command and then corresponding inputs. "i" will
insert strings into tree, r will return the number of nodes between two strings in the 
tree. 
  - i <string to insert>
  - r <string 1> <string2>



Citations (example code is the stack recursion example):
- bst.cpp follows the structure of the example code, with alterations
to accomodate for integers for queen locations
- avl tree simulator was used to help visualize tree structure and how/when rotations happened. 
- AVL tree wiki page was used to learn about how avl self balances. 
- wrapper.cpp's main function takes the structure of the example code, including code from last
assignment's code to intake lines of a file.
