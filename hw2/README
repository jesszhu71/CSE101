------------------------------------------------------------

This is an assignment using stacks to place n queens on an
nxn board where none of the queens attack each other. 

------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE:
1) Run "make", to get executable "nqueens".
2) Run "./nqueens <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>"

Each line of the input file contains an integer representing the board 
size (aka number of queens to place) and then two integers (row and col) 
between 1 and n for each inputed queen on the board. 



Citations (example code is the stack recursion example):
- node.cpp follows the structure of the example code, with alterations
to accomodate for integers for queen locations
- list.cpp takes the basic functions of a linkedlist from the example
code and I added more complex functions to manipulate my lists and 
complete my program
- wrapper.cpp's main function takes the structure of the example code, with include code from last
assignment's code to intake lines of a file. Helper function takes the structure of how the stack 
was set up from the example code (else is original);
